## About

This test has been designed to test the fundamentals required for PHP Engineers to work at [Flicker Leap](https://flickerleap.com). This test is continuously being updated to further test the fundamentals of being a PHP Engineer.

## We will test for the following:

1. Ability to work with version control
2. Ability to work with composer
3. Understanding of PHP
4. Understanding of OOP (Object-Orientated Programming)
4. Ability to work with APIs
5. Ability to solve logic problems

## Expected outcomes

- Ability to fulfill role
- Problem solving
- Willingness to ask when stuck
- Ability to deliver on what was requested
- Continuously improve what exists

## Test

Note: Whilst you are not specifically given a time limit to complete the test, we do expect it to be done sooner rather than later. When we are notified of the fork, we would be expecting the test back in the next week or so.

### 0. Please use the PSR2 coding standards if you know them. If you don't, that's OK - *it will not count against you.*

### 1. Fork this repo

The test will be considered complete when you send a link to your repo. It must be forked from this one.

As good practice, commit each stage of this test before moving to the next.

### 2. Add the required dependancies via composer.

Some have been included already so just include the following one: `composer require nategood/httpful`. Read more [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md)

### 3. Hello World!

Let's get down to writing down some code. We're assuming that you know how to create a PHP file and `echo 'Hello World';`. So let's jump straight in. 

### 4. Implement a class

Using the existing class, output a square which is 10 "pixels" wide.

### 5. Extend a class

Extend the Shape class to create a diamond that works with any passed length. 

### 6. Fix a class

Fix the Rectangle class. The rectangle that should be drawn should have its longest side twice as long as the shortest. It has a number of coding standards errors, syntax errors and logic errors.

### 7. Use Httpful to do an API call

Do a GET request to `http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mewtwo/` and output 3 items from the result (remember to help us understand what is being output using item label / name).

### 8. Suggest an improvement to the test

We believe in collective knowledge. Suggest a way (any constructive way) that can improve this test.
